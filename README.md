This project is primarily based and inspired from the ‘Time Series Momentum’ paper by Moschowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen. In this paper, the authors apply simple momentum strategies on the most liquid instruments across various asset classes by using its own past k-month return (e.g., 12 months) to determine a directional signal (long if positive, short if negative), then size the position inversely to volatility. This paper is particularly known for highlighting a very insightful behavioral trait observed in markets, where there is under reaction in the immediate future but delayed over reaction. 

Deep Learning techniques allow us to capture this non-linear phenomenon that is directly observable in periodic (12 months) intervals. For time series data, we choose to focus on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, as their structural properties perfectly align with the nature of this momentum based capture of alpha from past returns. I further optimize the model architecture and training style through hyperparameter optimization and cross validation that can be directly translated into real world trading.
